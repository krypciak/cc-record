# CrossCode recorder

Records the CrossCode window and ALL desktop audio!  
This is not meant for recording playthroughs, speedruns and things of that sort.  
The video quality of the recordings is not the greatest.  
It's mostly meant for quick showcases.  
I also use it to get feedback from people playing my [CrossedEyes](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CrossedEyes) mod.

## Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krypciak/cc-record
cd cc-record
pnpm install
pnpm run start
# this should return no errors (hopefully)
npx tsc
```
